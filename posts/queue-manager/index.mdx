import QueueAnimation from './animation';

Consider an assembly line involving two rats, Sam and Eric.
Sam is at the beginning of the assembly line, grabbing food items from a bin.
Once Sam has an item of food, he is able to queue it on a table for Eric to grab.
Eric then takes the food item, moves it to somewhere safe, and eats it.
Meanwhile, Sam may return to the line to grab another food item.
Sam is only allowed to place an item of food on the table (i.e. _queue_ an item of food) when said table is empty.
Sam is only allowed to grab an item of food from the bin if his hands are empty.
Eric is only allowed to take an item of food from the table (i.e. _dequeue_ an item of food) if he has finished eating his last food item.
Sam and Eric vary in the times they take to do their tasks: food-grabbing and food-eating durations distribute in an undetermined fashion.
Consequently, Sam may sometimes wait for Eric to finish his food before queueing a new item of food, and Eric may sometimes wait for Sam to grab more food before eating.

    Note that each rat must wait at the table in this example.
  </div>
</div>

Sam and Eric are concurrently performing tasks that require synchronization.
Sam must pause his loop of grabbing if he realizes the queue is full, and Eric can only eat an item that Sam has put in the queue.
Thus, their tasks are not merely done in _parallel_, as some synchronization must occur.
In this post, I will program a _queue manager_, which is the name I give to an object that spawns the process we just described.

## Declaring traits

Let us start by declaring a simple trait which encodes the blocking calculation of Sam at the food container.

`embed:queue-manager.rs#L9-16`

The associated type `Payload` corresponds to the type of objects Sam is moving, while `Marker` serves as a piece of information that Sam uses to grab the next item.
The execution cycle of Sam (the _grabber_) is effectively that he:

1. initializes some `Marker` via `BlockingGrabber::init`,
2. uses the `Marker` to grab a `Payload` via `BlockingGrabber::grab`,
3. uses the `Payload` to get a new `Marker` via `BlockingGrabber::next`,
4. Repeats to step 2.

This cycle will be halted if Sam ever receives the `None` variant of the `Option<Marker>` and `Option<Payload>` return types of the above methods.
It is useful to have `BlockingGrabber` as a trait, because we have a variety of use cases for our queue manager.
For instance, the `BlockingGrabber` can be implemented to grab items from a database, a sequence of files, a network stream, etc.

We will also implement a trait `Syncer` that will allow the queue manager to synchronously send queue information out of the program.
In the context of this post, the `Syncer` will write a log to a file:

`embed:log.txt`


which determines the very animation above.
This trait simply has a single method `Syncer::sync`.

`embed:queue-manager.rs#L18-21`

## Implementing QueueManager

We declare a struct `QueueManager` which will asynchronously spawn 4-step grabbing process described above.
With the help of Rust's popular asynchronous runtime, <Cite bibKey="tokio">Tokio</Cite><Cite bibKey="tokio-docs"/>, implementing our  `QueueManager` is simple.
Namely, the `tokio::sync::mpsc::channel` function will create a channel through which Futures may send data.
This channel will block the sender Futures if it is at capacity and block the receiver processes if there is no data in the channel.

Let us look at the fields of this struct for some intuition.

`embed:queue-manager.rs#L23-28`

See how it has fields `grabber` and `syncer` which it uses to obtain data to queue in the channel and synchronously inform the outside work about this data.
Meanwhile, the `receiver` is a struct which we use to provide an interface which allows a user to dequeue items from the channel.
We design our API to behave like so.

```rust
let mut manager = QueueManager::new(...)
let opt_payload = manager.recv().await;
if let Some(payload) = opt_payload {
  // do stuff with `payload`, which has type `Payload` associated with the 
  // grabber
}
```

Setting up the `recv` method calls for a simple composition of `manager.receiver.recv`, along with some additional `syncer` logic.
The implementation of the method `recv` is shown below.

`embed:queue-manager.rs#L87-93`

Now, the nontrivial part: How do we implement the spawning of the grabber cycle?
If we understand the structure of Rust's `async/await` execution (Jon Gjengset's stream <Cite bibKey="crust-of-rust-async">Crust of Rust: async/await</Cite> is an excellent resource), it turns out to be quite easy.
All we must do is spawn a Future which loops the 4-step cycle, and the `.await` call on the channel sender will perform all of our desired blocking.
Let us show the entirety of our implementation.

`embed:queue-manager.rs#L30-94`

## Implementing the traits with logging

The machinery is now in place, but we must still implement the traits.
We implement a simple example which simulates a simple queue and exports a log which helps us render the animation above.
The service times of Sam and Eric will be hardcoded by the following constants.

`embed:queue-manager.rs#L96-99`

Above, `VALS` is simply the list of values Sam will grab, `BLOCKS` is the list of times for how long each item will take Sam to grab, and `SERVES` are the list of times for how long each item will take Eric to eat.
These constants will be used in the implementation of `SimpleGrabber`, which implements the `BlockingGrabber` trait.

`embed:queue-manager.rs#L101-141`

Notice that, as the name `BlockingGrabber` suggests, we implemented `SimpleGrabber` to block the thread during the grabbing, via `std::thread::sleep`.
This is intended to simulate how the grabbing operation would likely come from a library that is implemented outside of the Future executor.
Note that we also threaded our `Syncer` into the `SimpleGrabber`, as we would like to log the grabbing operations.

The `Syncer` will create a file handle and a timer, so that the implementation of `sync` will log the messages to the file at the time they are sent.
We wrap the file handle in an atomic reference counter and mutex to ensure safe syncing between threads.

`embed:queue-manager.rs#L143-170`

## Running the simulation

Now that everything is implemented, we run the program.

`embed:queue-manager.rs#L172-197`

We again display the file that is created from this program, along with the entirety of the code.

`embed:queue-manager.rs`
`embed:log.txt`
