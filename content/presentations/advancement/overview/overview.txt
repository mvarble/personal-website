========
SLIDE 04
========

---

- defined on nontrivial spaces, e.g. positive, positive-definite matrices.
- simple parameterizations for such constraints.

- Duffie, et al.: Starts the abstraction. Classifies. Establishes properties we like.
- Filipovic: Shows time-inhomogeneity is easily introduced.
- Keller-Ressel: Shows sufficient regularity for stochastic integration.
- Cuchiero: Consolidated much of the theory for general processes
- Filipovic, et al.: Density approximations. Econometrics + numerical pricing.
- Kang, Kang: LDPs of affine diffusions. Inspiration of our current work, though limited to smaller class of processes.
- Keller-Ressel, et al.: General affine transform formula. Give us the (Riccati ODE minimal solution <-> existence of process + MGF) we need
- Xiaowei, Glynn: stochastic stability and limit theorems ~> more econometrics
- Keller-Ressel. Still weakening regularity assumptions on processes.


========
SLIDE 06
========

Objective: Mention their uses in modeling

---

- The many results (of SLIDE 04) allows tractability of processes. Mention econometrics + pricing.
- The large class of processes (of SLIDE 05) encourages them to be used in modeling. 
    - interest rates (i.e.: short rate / forward rate = affine process)
    - asset pricing (i.e.: assets / exogenous market factors are in cross-exciting affine process)
    - credit risk (i.e.: defaults = jumps of complicated affine point process)
    - high-frequency trading (i.e. infinite activity jumps)

      Mention: 
        Vasicek, CIR = OU, square-root diffusion
        Heston/Stochastic vol = CIR, positive-definite matrices


========
SLIDE 07
========

Objective: 
  Focus in slightly on one of these examples.
  Use this example to:
    1. naturally transition back to P(X in A)
    2. very lightly showcase compensator measures in action, 
        warming up audience for the more detailed analysis in our results.

---

* Credit risk example

- Establish model of high-dimensional cross-exciting affine diffusions.
- Fit the parameters of the model to market data.
- One of the coupled components is a positive process
- The exceedence of the integral of this process will identify default has occurred
- Note that this is an affine point process; show compensator measure expression

SLIDE 09
========

Objective: Introduce the relative error

---

- Want confidence intervals on correct order of magnitude
- CLT approximation ~> use relative error
- Observe that relative error of crude Monte Carlo is large for small P(X in A)
- Want small relative error

========
SLIDE 10
========

Objective: introduce importance sampling

---

[picture] + dP/dQ explanation

========
SLIDE 11
========

Objective: importance sampling is tricky

---

- (returning to relative error) optimal change of measure exists but intractable
- Work with families we can still sample
    - Variance may not even be finite!
    - Variance still intractable for such families
- Approximate with asymptotic regime; asymptotic efficiency can be put in a hierarchy.
    - relative error vanishes ε -> 0
    - relative error bounded ε -> 0
    - relative error sub-exponential ε -> 0

========
SLIDE 12
========

Objective: Showcase where such a regime may show up.

---

- Demonstrate picture of "rare" sample path that exceeded probability

- Throw up vague differential: dXɛₜ = b(Xɛₜ)dt + ε^(1/2) σ(Xɛₜ) dWₜ

- animation of dXɛₜ = b(Xɛₜ)dt + ε^(1/2) σ(Xɛₜ) dWₜ
  - note it does not simply look like "noise decreasing" by state dependence of drift+diffusion
  - note that perturbations disappear, limiting to solution of a linear ODE dxₜ = b(xₜ) dt
  - Heuristic: move the limit path up to have it *just* exceed the boundary.
               If we have a spectrum of changes of measure with ε leading up to this,
               they will capture the concentration we desire.
  - Heuristic: efficient for small ε = efficient in the asymptotic

========
SLIDE 13
========

Objective: Show how LDPs offer asymptotically efficient estimators.

---

(Similar to Kang & Kang or Pham)

- Show original variance we want to produce
- Vaguely state how Girsanov allows us to perform drift change in previous animation.
- Showcase new expression to minimize.
- Highlight certain expressions, stating that LDPs allow us to understand asymptotics of these objects
- Vaguely state how such LDPs leads to new expression
- Remark that solving this variational problem via something like Euler-Lagrange produces an informed change of measure.

========
SLIDE 14
========

Objective: State where work is to be done with regards to this story.

---

* What we have:

- LDP established for affine diffusions.
- LDP ~> calculus of variations problem ~> informed choice of sampling measure

* What can be done:

- LDP established for all affine processes.
- Clear up details.
   - Simply understand how to sample general affine processes (jumps can introduce massive bias to schemes)
   - Prove one can switch min-max and that the variational problem has a unique solution.
   - Provide simulations which test the hypotheses
- For applications to importance sampling, our LDP informs

Objective: Summary

---

- Affine processes are a rich class of processes that can exhibit desired properties
- Affine processes are tractable and have a very well-understood structure
- People are currently using affine processes for modeling
- Sometimes want P(X in A)
- Large deviations of affine processes allow for asymptotic estimates and inform numerical algorithms
- We intend to prove these large deviations principles and study their effects on these algorithms.
- Potentially lead to efficient calculation of P(X in A), along with abstraction P(f(X))
